# Deep Learning for Traffic Prediction (DLTP): A survey

Mainly Contributed and Maintained by Geyuan Wang, Wenjun Jiang, Jiawei Jiang. 

We collect must-read papers, public datasets and open source code about deep learning for traffic prediction according to task type. 

Task type mainly include Survey Papers, Traffic Flow Prediction, Traffic Speed Prediction, On-Demand Service Prediction, Travel Time Prediciton, Traffic Accident Prediction, Traffic Location Prediction, Transfer Learning and Meta Learning, AutoML and Others. 

The summary of open source datasets include Task type, datasets name, Sample References, Link,	Time interval, Prediction window, Duration,	and Description. 

Open souce code of the state of art deep learning models for traffic prediction are collected.
